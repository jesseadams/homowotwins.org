Nii Ardey Allotey has extensive experience performing and teaching traditional dancing, singing, and drumming of Ghana. He is a member of the Ga tribe and grew up in the capital of Accra. The family house was a training ground for current and aspiring master drummers and apprentices. 

Allotey began performing at the age of five. By his teens, he was touring Romania, Italy, Yugoslavia, the U.S.S.R., and beyond with cultural groups, including Ghana Cultural Ballet, as lead dancer and drummer. He performed and taught as a member of the Arts Council of Ghana, as he continued his personal study of cultural dance and music from across Ghana. 

After relocating to the US in 1983, Allotey continued to perform, teach, tour, and lead performance groups. Since 1988, Nii Ardey has taught classes for children and adults at schools, churches, and other facilities throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington. Allotey is the founder and leader of Portland-based group “Ekome” (meaning “unity”) that performs traditional Ghanaian music and dance. He remains committed to sharing African culture, music, and performance with Oregonians through classes and the production of the annual Homowo & Twins Festival in Portland.
